# Pomodoro APP

### What is pomodoro ? 

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.

It uses a timer to break down work into intervals, 25 minutes, separated by short 5 minutes breaks. 

Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato'.
